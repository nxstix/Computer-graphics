Fundamentals of Computer Graphics/Computergrafik Grundlagen at Berliner Hochschule f√ºr Technik (BHT)
Media computer science/Medieninformatik BSc

During the summer semester 2022, I attended the "Fundamentals of Computer Graphics" course with Prof. Dr. Henrik Tramberend. 
Throughout the course, we were challenged with multiple Java programming exercises that covered the fundamentals of computer graphics and ray tracing. From simple image creation, with iteration through every pixel creating a simple circle, to creating 3D objects with different textures and materials.
